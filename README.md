# Introduction

As Bill Gates said: “We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.” At HackYourFuture we agree with Bill. Feedback works. 
The students know if they’re on the right track and they learn efficiently by implementing feedback on their homework. 
The teachers get an overview on the concepts that may need some extra attention in class and they see which students need some extra help. 
In this document a framework is given that can help you review homework of students in HackYourFuture. 
As you know, volunteering at HYF is module based. If you’re going to help out in a module as homework support you’ll review around 4 or 5 homework submissions per week as long as that module lasts (normally 3 weeks). This will take +/- 4 hours per week. Once you’ve helped out multiple times in the same module, it will  take less time of course.

# Homeworkflow 
In the first module (HTML/CSS) students will hand in their homework via Trello. Starting from Javascript 1, week 1, students need to hand in their homework via [GitHub](https://github.com/HackYourHomework). They have to do this every week before the deadline on Tuesday at 23:59.

The code of the students has to be reviewed within a week after the deadline (every Tuesday) so the students can improve their work as soon as possible.
After implementing the requested changes the reviewer has to check if the improvements fit the requirements of the assignment and if so, approve the homework.  
-Pull Request:
One of our teachers (Jim Cramer) has documented his way of reviewing homework on GitHub. It’s a very clear and practical document that you can use as a roadmap for the reviewing process with pull requests. 
This is the github account where our students submit their homework.
Please send your username to Tjebbe on Slack, then he will add you to the organization. 
-Trello (only for the HTML/CSS module): 
Students hand in their homework (a link to their GitHub repository) on a board in the list for that week. When you’re assigned to check their homework you’ll get an invitation for the board. 
You can click on their card to see the link to their repo and/or sites that the students had to build. 
label the card with: ‘Review in Process’
The feedback on the code can be given in a comment on their card.
Label the card with: ‘Reviewed’ 
If the student needs to make adjustments to pass the homework you add the label: ‘Needs work’
When the student implemented the requested changes, remove the label ‘needs work’

# Best practices 
There are five points of which we think are essential for good feedback in HackYourFuture.

## Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes. But it’s very important to give  positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the student more confident. We’re also learning from what we did well.

## Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the student knows which part of the code needs improvement.

## Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way the student will have an idea on how to improve the code. You push him/her in the right direction. Keep in mind that there is a balance between suggestions and self study. Giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do. 

## Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. 
As a rule of thumb we say that a normal review is somewhere between the 10 and 15 comments. 
When you have the feeling that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact him or her on Slack to plan an online call!

## Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, it’s recommended to write a small summary at the top where you: 
can give a compliment to the student
Let them know if they need to make changes 
Reflect upon the topics for that week  and if you think (s)he understands them.

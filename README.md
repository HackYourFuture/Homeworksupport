# Introduction
Every week students have to hand in homework assignments. In the first module (HTML/CSS) students will hand in their homework via Trello. Starting from Javascript 1, they need to hand in their homework on GitHub with a pull request (like this). These assignments are key to measure their progress and to put into practice what they have learned. To have an extra check on how the students are doing there are three tests inside the curriculum. (after HTML/CSS, Javascript 2, Javascript 3, Node.js and React).

As a homework assistant you will check and provide feedback on the homework of the students and optionally revise their tests. Feedback should be provided within a week after homework has been submitted.
